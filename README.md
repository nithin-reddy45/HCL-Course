# HCL-Course
Ongoing HCL Data Analytics course, gaining hands-on experience in Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn). Worked on data preprocessing, visualization, and model training using logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and regularized regression, strengthening end-to-end ML workflow skills.
